# Environmental Impact Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the environmental impacts of air quality, water quality, and deforestation using real-world datasets. The study aims to explore trends, evaluate the effectiveness of environmental policies, and provide actionable recommendations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Exploration (01_data_exploration.ipynb)**  
   Initial inspection of the datasets, summary statistics, and visualizations to understand trends and distributions.

2. **Data Cleaning (02_data_cleaning.ipynb)**  
   Cleaning raw datasets to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. The cleaned datasets are saved in the `processed/` folder.

3. **Feature Engineering (03_feature_engineering.ipynb)**  
   Creating new features and preparing the data for analysis and modeling.

4. **Model Building (04_model_building.ipynb)**  
   Predicting pollution levels or other environmental metrics using regression models. Performance metrics are evaluated to ensure model accuracy.

5. **Policy Assessment (05_policy_assessment.ipynb)**  
   Assessing the impact of environmental policies by comparing pre- and post-policy metrics.

6. **Final Analysis (06_final_analysis.ipynb)**  
   Summarizing findings, visualizing trends, and providing actionable insights.

## Key Findings
- **Air Quality**: A significant improvement in AQI was observed after the implementation of air quality policies in 2010.
- **Water Quality**: The Water Quality Improvement Act of 2015 resulted in improved average pH levels across monitored locations.
- **Deforestation**: The Deforestation Reduction Agreement (2005) showed a notable reduction in the rate of forest loss, although further monitoring is needed.

## Recommendations
1. Continue enforcing air quality regulations to sustain improvements.
2. Invest in water treatment technologies for consistent water quality improvement.
3. Expand reforestation programs to further combat deforestation trends.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramanandworks/Environmental-Impact-Analysis.git
   cd Environmental-Impact-Analysis
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Navigate through the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder sequentially.
